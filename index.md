## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in computer sciences and applied mathematics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My interest lies in the intersection of **computer systems** and **machine learning**. It is my great fortune to work with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) on optimizing the system design for large-scale embedding inference and [Prof. Claudia Solis-Lemus](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/people.html) on employing deep neural networks on biological sequences at [Wisconsin Institute for Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu/).

<!-- ## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

## News

- **[Jan. 2024]** I joined Prof. Shivaram's group!
